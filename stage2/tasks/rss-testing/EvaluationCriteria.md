### Evaluation Criteria for RSS Testing (125 points - Total) ✅

#### 1. Testing Framework Integration (20 points) 🧪🔗

- **(20 points)** 🎯 Successfully integrate Jest for unit testing and DOM Testing Library for UI testing with proper configuration, ensuring both frameworks can run tests without errors. [RSS-TEST-1_01](./Sprint5/RSS-TEST-1_01.md)

#### 2. Script Configuration for Coverage Reporting (15 points) 📄📊

- **(15 points)** 🎯 Implement and configure a script in `package.json` for running tests with coverage reporting, generating a detailed coverage report in HTML format. This script should facilitate easy access to test coverage information, highlighting areas lacking tests. [RSS-TEST-2_01](./Sprint5/RSS-TEST-2_01.md)

#### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage (30 points) 🎯✅

- **(30 points)** 🎯 Achieve a unit test coverage of over 70% across the application. This entails writing tests that sufficiently cover the critical functionalities and components, ensuring a reliable and robust application. [RSS-TEST-3_01](./Sprint5/RSS-TEST-3_01.md)

#### 4. Snapshot Testing (20 points) 🖼️🔍

- **(20 points)** 🎯 Implement snapshot tests using Jest to ensure UI components render consistently across changes. These tests should capture UI components' states and detect unintended changes over time. [RSS-TEST-4_01](./Sprint5/RSS-TEST-4_01.md)

#### 5. Interaction Testing (20 points) 🖱️🧪

- **(20 points)** 🎯 Write tests that simulate user interactions such as clicks, input entry, and form submissions. These tests should validate the application's response to user actions, ensuring interactive elements function as expected. [RSS-TEST-5_01](./Sprint5/RSS-TEST-5_01.md)

#### 6. Date Mocking and Jest Functions (20 points) 📅🕵️

- **(10 points)** 🎯 Utilize Jest to mock dates within tests, ensuring that functionalities relying on dates are correctly tested without dependency on the current date. [RSS-TEST-6_01](./Sprint5/RSS-TEST-6_01.md)
- **(10 points)** 🎯 Implement tests using Jest's mock and spyOn functionalities to test functions and methods, particularly focusing on how components interact with external modules and APIs. This ensures a comprehensive evaluation of component integration and behavior. [RSS-TEST-6_02](./Sprint5/RSS-TEST-6_02.md)
